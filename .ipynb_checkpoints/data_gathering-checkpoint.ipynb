    "# Data Gathering\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is dedicated to gathering data, because its note wise to comne these functions with data analysis. Gathering data from this site takes some time and may slow down the analysis. The data is hug in size compared to what github allows to be uploaded, so I have to include this into to .gitignore file.\n",

    "\n",
    "**THE SOLUTION**\n",
    "\n",
    "The solultion for going around the limit is to do a sorting by some value and give it a limiting condition. But how so? with MTID, and using MTID as a first level sorting. Something like this:\n",

Now I have to play with the reponses to see when to end the constant rolling of the responses. As far as I know, if the response contains no content, its a smart query describing that there is no result.
