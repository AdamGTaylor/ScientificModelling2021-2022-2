# Presented Notebooks

project.ipynb

    This notebook if for testing out stuff that is being used later on

data_gathering.ipynb

    This notebook's main function isto gather the data from mtmt
    Most values are burnt in. Succesfull bypass of 5000 publications
    limit by making multiple files.

real_data_ana.ipynb

    Applying successfully tested stuff to our data.

# Notes

## Revelant Publcations

### Co-.athorship Network Analysis: A Powerful Tool for Strategic Planning...

    https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0000501

### Co-Authorship Networks In the Digital Library Research Community

    https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0502056.pdf

## Data

    The data is downloaded and it takes up to 2.61 GB.

## Current goals

    1. Multiple networks (kind of success)
    2. Evolving Networks (only animation)
    3. Indicators (needs invesigation)

    Maybe we can do averages on multiple stages to see the change 
    during the evolution

    Later on:
    4. Group finding methods
    5. Embedding

## Mid end End term code

    It is highly likely that I convert my jupyter notebooks into
    pdf files.

## NOTES (03.31.)

Betweeness:

    High betweeness, low degree means bridges.

Multi-connected components:

Core:

    Which are the nodes that connected with X amount of edges.

Bridges:

    Would be handful to look at.

PageRank:

    Do me!

Motif Statistics:

    Group finding method on entrance level.

After that we can try group finding methods. Don't touch embedding beforehand!


## ISSUES

    Still don't get how to go around the 5000 publication limit.
    Didn't really find it in the API documentation while I have worked
    with ReST API before and making query with an url is not some alien 
    technology.
